# SSOReady-Go: SAML & SCIM for Golang

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ssoready/ssoready-go.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ssoready/ssoready-go)

`github.com/ssoready/ssoready-go` is a Go SDK for the
[SSOReady](https://ssoready.com) API.

SSOReady is a set of open-source dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You
can use SSOReady to add SAML and SCIM support to your product this afternoon.

For example applications built using SSOReady-Go, check out:

- [SSOReady Example App: Golang + net/http with SAML](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-example-app-golang-saml)

## Installation

Run the following:

```bash
go get github.com/ssoready/ssoready-go
```

## Usage

This section provides a high-level overview of how SSOReady works, and how it's
possible to implement SAML and SCIM in just an afternoon. For a more thorough
introduction, visit the [SAML
quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs/saml/saml-quickstart) or the [SCIM
quickstart](https://ssoready.com/docs/scim/scim-quickstart).

The first thing you'll do is create a SSOReady client instance:

```go
import (
	"github.com/ssoready/ssoready-go"
	ssoreadyclient "github.com/ssoready/ssoready-go/client"
)

ssoreadyClient := ssoreadyclient.NewClient()
```

### SAML in two lines of code

SAML (aka "Enterprise SSO") consists of two steps: an _initiation_ step where
you redirect your users to their corporate identity provider, and a _handling_
step where you log them in once you know who they are.

To initiate logins, you'll use SSOReady's [Get SAML Redirect
URL](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/saml/get-saml-redirect-url)
endpoint:

```go
// this is how you implement a "Sign in with SSO" button
getRedirectURLRes, err := ssoreadyClient.SAML.GetSAMLRedirectURL(ctx, &ssoready.GetSAMLRedirectURLRequest{
    OrganizationExternalID: "...",
})
if err != nil { ... }

// redirect the user to getRedirectURLRes.RedirectURL ...
```

You can use whatever your preferred ID is for organizations (you might call them
"workspaces" or "teams") as your `OrganizationExternalID`. You configure those
IDs inside SSOReady, and SSOReady handles keeping track of that organization's
SAML and SCIM settings.

To handle logins, you'll use SSOReady's [Redeem SAML Access
Code](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/saml/redeem-saml-access-code) endpoint:

```go
redeemRes, err := ssoreadyClient.SAML.RedeemSAMLAccessCode(ctx, &ssoready.RedeemSAMLAccessCodeRequest{
	SAMLAccessCode: "saml_access_code_...",
})

// log the user in as redeemRes.Email inside redeemRes.OrganizationExternalID
```

You configure the URL for your `/ssoready-callback` endpoint in SSOReady.

### SCIM in one line of code

SCIM (aka "Enterprise directory sync") is basically a way for you to get a list
of your customer's employees offline.

To get a customer's employees, you'll use SSOReady's [List SCIM
Users](https://ssoready.com/docs/api-reference/scim/list-scim-users) endpoint:

```go
listSCIMUsersRes, err := ssoreadyClient.SCIM.ListSCIMUsers(ctx, &ssoready.SCIMListSCIMUsersRequest{
	OrganizationExternalID: "...",
})
if err != nil { ... }

// create users from each scim user
for _, scimUser := range listSCIMUsersRes.SCIMUsers { 
	// each scimUser has an ID, Email, Attributes, and Deleted
}
```

Issues and PRs are more than welcome. Be advised that this library is largely
autogenerated from [`ssoready/docs`](https://github.com/ssoready/docs). Most
code changes ultimately need to be made there, not on this repo.
